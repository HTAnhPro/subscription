# Subscriptions

A small Stellar dApp on testnet for recurring on-chain payments. The subscriber commits to N XLM per period for M periods up front; the merchant claims one period's worth at a time as each window elapses. Either side can cancel mid-stream and unclaimed periods refund automatically.

## How It Works

A subscription is a stream of fixed-size XLM transfers gated by the ledger clock. The subscriber locks intent on chain (per-period amount, period count, period length, merchant address). The merchant pulls one period at a time after each window has fully elapsed. Cancelling closes the stream and any unclaimed periods are refundable to the subscriber.

```

The contract is an accounting ledger. XLM moves via Horizon payments alongside the contract calls (same pattern as project 01 Tip Jar). A `Subscription` row holds `(subscriber, merchant, per_period, periods, claimed, period_seconds, opened_at, status)` and transitions `Active → Cancelled` on cancel or `Active → Completed` once `claimed == periods`.

The "claim one window at a time" rule is enforced on chain: `claim` rejects with `NotYetDue` until `now >= opened_at + (claimed + 1) * period_seconds`. Once the next window has elapsed the merchant can pull. Multiple windows can accumulate — if the merchant skips two cycles, a single `claim` call still only releases one period at a time.

## Try It Locally

You'll need:

- Node 22+
- Rust stable + the Stellar CLI (`stellar` v25+, with the `wasm32v1-none` target installed)
- A Stellar testnet wallet (Freighter, xBull, Lobstr, or Albedo all work)
- A funded testnet account (Friendbot or Freighter's one-click fund)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HTAnhPro/subscription.git
cd subscription
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

The deployed contract id ships in `.env.example` so the app works against testnet immediately. Open http://localhost:3000, connect a wallet, and create a subscription to yourself or a second wallet you control.

## Deploying Your Own Contract

If you want a fresh contract under your own admin key:

```bash
stellar keys generate alice --network testnet --fund   # if you don't have a key
./scripts/deploy.sh alice
```

What the script does:

1. Builds the wasm (`stellar contract build` on `contract/main`).
2. Deploys it to testnet under `alice` as the source.
3. Rewrites `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIN_CONTRACT_ID` in `.env.local`.
4. Prints the Stellar Expert link for the freshly deployed contract.

Full notes live in [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](./docs/DEPLOY.md). Frontend deploys to Vercel automatically on push to `main`.

## Tests

```bash
cd contract && cargo test
```

8 tests covering the full lifecycle:

- `create_records_subscription`
- `claim_after_one_period_succeeds`
- `claim_before_period_returns_error`
- `cancel_refunds_unclaimed_periods`
- `multiple_claims_accumulate`
- `claim_past_total_returns_error`
- `cancel_then_claim_blocked`
- `non_merchant_cannot_claim`

CI runs them on every push (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Error Handling

Eight typed contract errors plus three frontend errors in `lib/errors.ts`:

Contract:

- `AmountMustBePositive` — non-positive `per_period` or `periods` on `create`.
- `NotFound` — `claim` / `cancel` against a `sub_id` that was never created.
- `NotMerchant` — `claim` called by anyone other than the merchant on the subscription.
- `NotSubscriber` — `cancel` called by anyone other than the subscriber.
- `NotYetDue` — `claim` before the next period window has elapsed.
- `AlreadyComplete` — `claim` after `claimed == periods`.
- `AlreadyCancelled` — `claim` or `cancel` against a subscription already closed.
- `NotInitialized` — XLM SAC address missing from instance storage.

Frontend (`lib/errors.ts`):

- `WalletNotFoundError` — no Stellar wallet detected in the browser.
- `UserRejectedError` — user closed the wallet popup.
- `InsufficientBalanceError` — `op_underfunded` or not enough XLM for the next period.
